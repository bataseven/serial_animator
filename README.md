# Serial Animator

## What is this?
A python script to visualize the serial data on a real time plot. It utilizes matplotlib library to generate the plot. The script does the following:

* Connects to and reads from a serial port.
* Parses each line coming from the serial port into the labels and values.
* Draws values with different labels on to the plot.
* Provides checkboxes to toggle data labels.
* Automatically scales the y-axis to fit the visible lines.
